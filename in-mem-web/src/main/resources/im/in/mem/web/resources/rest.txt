Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?
Mean Response Time
This is the most common measure of response time, but alas, usually is the most flawed as well. The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements?

This is the most common measure of response time, but alas, usually is the most flawed as well. The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.

Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?
Mean Response Time
This is the most common measure of response time, but alas, usually is the most flawed as well. The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.

The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?

You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?
Mean Response Time
This is the most common measure of response time, but alas, usually is the most flawed as well. The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond?

This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?

You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?
Mean Response Time
This is the most common measure of response time, but alas, usually is the most flawed as well. The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond?

This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?

When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?
Mean Response Time
This is the most common measure of response time, but alas, usually is the most flawed as well. The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements?

For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?
Mean Response Time
This is the most common measure of response time, but alas, usually is the most flawed as well. The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?

The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements? Although they sound fine for general conversation, anyone interested in performance should really be asking what exactly do they mean.
Let’s take the first statement above and make the assumption that it refers to a particular page in a web application. When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?

When someone says that the response time is 5 seconds, does it mean that when this user typed in the URL of this page, the browser took 5 seconds to respond? Or does it mean that in an automated test repeatedly accessing this page, the average response time was 5 seconds? Or perhaps, the median response time was 5 seconds?
You get the idea. For some reason, people tend to talk loosely about response times. Without going into  details of how to measure the response time (that’s a separate topic), this article will focus on what is a meaningful response time metric.
For purposes of this discussion, let us assume we are measuring the response time of a transaction (which can be anything – web, database, cache etc.) What is the most meaningful measure for the response time of a transaction?
Mean Response Time
This is the most common measure of response time, but alas, usually is the most flawed as well. The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.Do you see anything wrong in these statements?

The mean or average response time simply adds up all the individual response times taken from multiple measurements and divides it by the number of samples to get an average. This may be fine if the measurements are fairly evenly distributed over a narrow range as in Figure 1.
